### Solar System View

You can rotate around the solar system view to take a look at the moon from different angles, and see how the sun ilumminates it.

### Earth View

On the earth view (visible in bigger screens like laptops and tablets) the moon is shown in our earth perspective.

### How it works

Simply move the slider button from one side to another to rotate the moon and show the correspondent phase.
